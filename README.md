# Global-Sales-Performance-Insights

## Overview

This project features two comprehensive **Global Sales Performance Dashboards** designed in Excel, focusing on key performance indicators for sales, profit, and unit distribution across various segments, products, and countries for 2018 and 2019. The dashboards are interactive, allowing users to filter data based on **Segments**, **Countries**, **Products**, **Months**, and **Discount Bands**, which offers deeper insights into sales patterns.

### Dashboard Visual Themes
1. **Classic Blue-Themed Dashboard**: Provides a high-level overview of total sales, profits, and units sold, with detailed segment breakdowns and product sales performance across different years.
2. **Modern Dark-Themed Dashboard**: Offers deeper insights into product and segment performance across different countries, alongside monthly profitability and the impact of discounts on sales.

### Dashboard Components Breakdown

1. **Slicers**:

   - **Government** is the highest-selling segment across most countries, especially in the USA and Canada, which indicates strong government procurement.
   - **Small Business** has moderate performance in all regions, which suggests it may need a more targeted approach to drive growth in those markets.

3. **Product Highest Profit Made in Each Country (Bar Chart)**:
   - **Amarilla** performs exceptionally well in the USA and Canada, generating the highest profit across these regions.
   - **Paseo** dominates in France, Mexico, and Germany, showing strong international performance.

## Recommendations

1. **Expand Focus on Government and Small Business Segments**:
   - Both segments consistently generate the highest profits, especially in the **USA** and **Canada**. Consider expanding product offerings tailored to these markets to capture more opportunities.

2. **Optimize Discount Strategies**:
   - The significant increase in profits during peak months (July and November) through **Medium** and **High** discount bands indicates that discount strategies are highly effective. Further refining these strategies for different months or regions could maintain high profit margins throughout the year.

3. **Increase Product Focus in the USA and Canada**:
   - The **Amarilla** product has proven to be the most profitable in these regions. Introducing variations or complementary products could capitalize on this strong market performance.

4. **Leverage Seasonal Trends for Products Like Carretera**:
   - Since **Carretera** sees high demand toward the end of the year, investing in marketing campaigns during the fourth quarter could further boost sales. Exploring similar seasonal strategies for other products could diversify revenue streams.
